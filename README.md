Hi there, I'm Harsh! ðŸ‘‹

About Me

Iâ€™m a final-year B.Tech student with a passion for blending technology and creativity. While I work towards becoming a proficient software developer, my heart also beats for the arts. Philosophy, history, poetry, literature, films, and storytelling are my true inspirations.

Tech Skills

Programming Languages: Java, Basics of Python, C, C++, JS

Web Development: Spring, Spring Boot, React 

Other Skills: Git, REST APIs, Basic SQL

Iâ€™m currently learning advanced Spring Boot and exploring backend development practices. My ultimate goal is to develop robust and scalable applications.

Creative Pursuits

Outside of tech, Iâ€™m a writer. I write poems in Hindi, often focusing on themes like nature, love, and introspection. Iâ€™m also interested in:

Composing my poems into songs

Learning the basics of music composition

Exploring storytelling techniques for screenwriting and dialogue writing

Values & Aspirations

Lifelong Learner: I believe in growing every day, whether itâ€™s through coding or diving into a book on philosophy.

Honest Creator: My aim is to create authentic work that connects with people.

Balanced Life: While I aspire to build a successful career in IT, I also strive to nurture my creative passions.

Current Goals

Enhance my skills in backend development, particularly in Spring Boot.

Write and read more to gain new perspectives and improve my storytelling.
